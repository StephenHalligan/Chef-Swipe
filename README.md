There is no doubt that as technology advances, things like books and newspapers are falling behind. A large contributing factor to the downfall of print medium is the rise of eBooks and digital media. It’s undeniable that technology is becoming a staple of day-to-day living, which leaves us with the question; what will happen to print media in another 10 years? With deforestation becoming a larger issue than ever before, [14] the world is looking at other solutions to this old style of sharing content, and in this case – recipes. Instead of continually printing new books which must then be disposed of once used, the globe is turning to technology to meet its’ media-sharing needs.

This project proposes a solution to the ‘recipe books’ or ‘cookbooks’ of old, whereby generally less than 100 recipes are stored in one large hardback book. While this method worked well for centuries, modern technology now allows us to store not just hundreds, but millions of recipes on a mobile phone or in the cloud. Hence, the idea behind this project is to replace bulky cookbooks with a single application that aims to meet its users' recipe sharing and finding needs. 

This application will allow for users to interact with recipes, opening them up a new world of cooking they may not have experienced before. This gap in the market has been identified after researching many recipe applications currently available, and deciding that not many offer the level of interactivity valued in modern applications such as ‘Tinder’, or ‘TikTok’.

As this application can retrieve data from the internet, users have access to a near infinite number of recipes at their fingertips. This would have been unfathomable as a mobile application 20 years ago, but with modern technology like cloud databases and APIs, this application will provide content on-demand to users looking for new and exciting meals to make. 

Instead of sifting through pages upon pages of recipes and struggling to find the specific recipe you wish to make based on your individual needs and wants users of this application can swipe through a curated list of recipes filtered to cater to their allergies, preferences and requirements. Customisable filters and feed pages insure that users always find new recipes they will enjoy, in a fun and creative manner.

The community focused aspect of this application will allow users to share their own recipes, comment on recipes they have tried, and even follow their favourite creators. This social feature adds an engaging element to the application, alongside allowing users of different backgrounds and culinary preferences to connect and share their knowledge with other ‘foodies’

With the world becoming more reliant on technology by the day, we must adapt to the common challenges that come with these drastic changes. Hence, not only is this application a useful tool, but it is also an example of how we can embrace our reliance on technology, using it to enhance day-to-day living and promote sustainability.
